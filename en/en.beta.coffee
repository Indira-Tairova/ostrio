  Thank you for yours interest. During the beta-testing we have next functionality limitations:

  - SMS won't be sent. You can add mobile phones into your account, but confirmation SMS won't be sent;
  - You can't add money to your account. But your initial account balance is $15, this is enough for one server. If you're want more free credit - just text to us some explanation and we will add more credit to your account (our contacts can be found in footer of every page).

  During beta-testing and service updates, sometimes service may report inaccurate data, or be unavailable. In case of major functionality changes - data may be erased, lost or corrupted partly or entirely. Thank you for understanding and your help.
