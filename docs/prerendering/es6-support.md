Enable ES6 support for Prerendering
======

Love bleeding edge technology? Using ES6 and ES7 at your website? Great! We are happy to introduce ES6 and partial ES7 syntax support. This feature is not enabled by default and can be turned on individually for each host in "Prerendering" panel.

It the same as default Prerendring, but uses more modern JavaScript engine, which may be less stable.
