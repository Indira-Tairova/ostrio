Add an Email Address for Notifications
======

 - [Direct link to Contacts panel](https://ostr.io/account/contacts)

It is a good idea to separate email notifications across teams, team members, or to have two or more notification email addresses for critical events. Go to [contacts panel](https://ostr.io/account/contacts) ("Account" -> "Manage Contacts" -> "Add an Email Address"), enter email address you wish to add. Then click "Verify" link to send verification email with a link. Once you visit a link from sent email, new email address can be used for notifications
